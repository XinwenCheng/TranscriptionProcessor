Yeah.
Is everything in place.
You were not supposed to relieve me.
I know but I want to take your shift.
You like watching him do not you. You like watching him.
Do not be ridiculous.
We are going to kill him do you understand that.
Morpheus believes he is the one.
Do you.
It does not matter what I believe.
You do not do you.
Did you hear that.
Hear what.
Are you sure this line is clean.
Yeah of course I am sure.
I better go.


Freeze Police. Hands on your head. Do it. Do it now.


Lieutenant.
Oh shit.
Lieutenant you were given specific orders.
Hey I am just doing my job. You give me juris my diction crap you can cram it up your ass.
Your orders were for your protection.
I think we can handle one little girl I sent two units. They are bringing her down now.
No Lieutenant your men are already dead.


Morpheus the line was traced I do not know how.
I know they cut the hard line. There is no time you are going to have to get to another exit.
Are there any agents.
Yes.
God dammit.
You have to focus Trinity. There is a phone at Wells and Lake. You can make it.
All right.
Go.


That is impossible.


Get up Trinity. Just get up. Get up.


She got out.
It does not matter.
The informant is real.
Yes.
We have the name of their next target.
The name is Neo.
We will need a search running.
It has already begun.


What. What the hell. Follow the white rabbit. Who is it.
It is Choi.
Yeah. Yeah. You are two hours late.
I know it is her fault.
Got the money.
Two grand.
Hold on.
Hallelujah. You are my savior man. My own personal Jesus Christ.
You get caught using that.
Yeah I know. This never happened. You do not exist.
Right.
Something wrong man. You look a little whiter than usual.
My computer it You ever have that feeling where you are not sure if you are awake or still dreaming.
Mm all the time. It is called Mescaline. It is the only way to fly. Hey it just sounds to me like you need to unplug man. You know get some R and R. What do you think DuJour. Shall we take him with us.
Definitely.
I cannot I have work tomorrow.
Come on It will be fun. I promise.
Yeah sure I will go.


Hello Neo.
How do you know that name.
I know a lot about you.
Who are you.
My name is Trinity.
Trinity. The Trinity. That cracked the IRS d base.
That was a long time ago.
Jesus.
What.
I just thought um.you were a guy.
Most guys do.
It you on my computer. How did you do that.
Right now all I can tell you is that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you.
Of what.
They are watching you Neo.
Who is.
Please just listen. I know why you are here Neo. I know what you have been doing. I know why you hardly sleep why you live alone and why night after night you sit at your computer. You are looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me he told me I was not really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It is the question that drives us mad. It is the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did.
What is the Matrix.
The answer is out there Neo. It is looking for you. And it will find you if you want it to.


Oh shit. Oh shit shit.


You have a problem with authority Mr. Anderson. You believe that you are special that somehow the rules do not apply to you. Obviously you are mistaken. This company is one of the top software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are part of a whole. Thus if an employee has a problem the company has a problem. The time has come to make a choice Mr. Anderson. Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forward or you choose to find yourself another job. Do I make myself clear.
Yes Mr. Rhineheart perfectly clear.

Thomas Anderson.
Yeah that is me.
Ok great. Have a nice day.
Hello.
Hello Neo. Do you know who this is.
Morpheus.
Yes. I have been looking for you Neo. I do not know if you are ready to see what I want to show you but unfortunately you and I have run out of time. They are coming for you Neo and I do not know what they are going to do.
Who is coming for me.
Stand up and see for yourself.
What right now.
Yes now. Do it slowly. The elevator.
Oh shit.
Yes.
What the hell do they want from me.
I do not know but if you do not want to find out I suggest you get out of there.
How.
I can guide you but you must do exactly as I say.
Ok.
The cubicle across from you is empty.
What if they.
Go now.Stay here for just a moment. When I tell you go to the end of the row to the office at the end of the hall. Stay as low as you can Go now Good. Now outside there is a scaffold.
How do you know all this.
We do not have time Neo. To your left there is a window. Go to it Open it. You can use the scaffold to get to the roof.
No way. No way. This is crazy.
There are two ways out of this building. One is that scaffold the other is in their custody. You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.
This is insane. Why is this happening to me. What did I do. I am nobody Shit I cannot do this.


Shit.


As you can see we have had our eye on you for some time now Mr. Anderson. It seems that you have been living two lives. In one life you are Thomas A. Anderson program writer for a respectable software company you have a social security number you pay your taxes and you help your landlady carry out her garbage. The other life is lived in computers where you go by the hacker alias Neo and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for. One of these lives has a future and one of them does not. I am going to be as forthcoming as I can be Mr. Anderson. You are here because we need your help. We know that you have been contacted by a certain individual a man who calls himself Morpheus. Now whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant. He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive. My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you but I believe that you wish to do the right thing. We are willing to wipe the slate clean give you a fresh start and all that we are asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
Yeah. Wow that sound like a really good deal. But I think I got a better one. How about I give you the finger and you give me my phone call.
Um Mr. Anderson. You disappoint me.
You cannot scare me with this Gestapo crap. I know my rights. I want my phone call.
Tell me Mr. Anderson what good is a phone call if you are unable to speak You are going to help us Mr. Anderson whether you want to or not.


This line is tapped so I must be brief. They got to you first but they have underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know you would probably be dead.
What are you talking about. What.what is happening to me.
You are the one Neo. You see you may have spent the last few years looking for me but I have spent my entire life looking for you. Now do you still want to meet.
Yes.
Then go to the Adam Street Bridge.


Get in.

What the hell is this.
It is necessary Neo. For our protection.
From what.
From you. Take off your shirt.
What.
Stop the car. Listen to me Copper top. We do not have time for twenty questions. Right now there is only one rule our way or the highway.
Fine.
Please Neo. You have to trust me
Why.
Because you have been down there Neo. You know that road. You know exactly where it ends. And I know that is not where you want to be Apoc lights. Lie back lift up your shirt.
What is that thing.
We think you are bugged Try and relax Come on. Come on.
It is on the move.
Shit.
You are going to loose it.
No I am not. Clear.
Jesus Christ that thing is real.


This is it. Let me give you one piece of advice. Be honest. He knows more than you can imagine.

At last. Welcome Neo. As you no doubt have guessed I am Morpheus.
It is an honor to meet you.
No the honor is mine. Please come. Sit down. I imagine that right now you are feeling a bit like Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole. Hm.
You could say that.
I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. Ironically this is not far from the truth. Do you believe in fate Neo.
No.
Why not.
Because I do not like the idea that I am not in control of my life.
I know exactly what you mean. Let me tell you why you are here. You are here because you know something. What you know you cannot explain. But you feel it. You have felt it your entire life. That there is something wrong with the world. You do not know what it is but it is there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I am talking about.
The Matrix.
Do you want to know what IT is. The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us even now in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work when you go to church when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
What truth.
That you are a slave Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind Unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this there is no turning back. You take the blue pill the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes Remember all I am offering is the truth nothing more Follow me Apoc are we online.
Almost.
Time is always against us. Please take a seat there.

You did all this.
Uh huh.
The pill you took is part of a trace program. It is designed to disrupt your input or output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
What does that mean.
It means buckle your seat belt Dorothy because Kansas is going bye bye.

Did you.
Have you ever had a dream Neo that you were so sure was real. What if you were unable to wake from that dream. How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world.
This cannot be.
Be what. Be real.
It is going into replication.
Apoc.
Still nothing.
It is cold. It is cold.
Tank we are going to need a signal soon.
We have got fibrillation.
Apoc location.
Targeting almost there.
It is going into arrest.
Lock I have got him.
Now Tank. Now.


Welcome to the real world. We have done it Trinity. We have found him.
I hope you are right.
I do not have to hope. I know it.
Am I dead.
Far from it.

He still needs a lot of work.
What are you doing.
Your muscles have atrophied we are rebuilding them.
Why do my eyes hurt.
You have never used them before. Rest Neo. The answers are coming.

Morpheus what is happened to me. What is this place.
More important than what is when.
When.
You believe it is the year nineteen ninety nine when in fact it is closer to twenty one ninety nine. I cannot tell you exactly what year it is because we honestly do not know. There is nothing I can say that will explain it for you Neo. Come with me. See for yourself. This is my ship the Nebuchadnezzar. It is a hovercraft. This is the main deck. This is the core where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix. Most of my crew you already know. This is Apoc Switch and Cypher.
Hi.
The one is you do not know Tank and his big brother Dozer. The little one behind you is Mouse. You wanted to know what the Matrix is Neo. Trinity Try to relax. This will feel a weird.


This is the construct. It is our loading program. We can load anything from clothing to equipment weapons training simulations anything we need.
Right now we are inside a computer program.
Is it really so hard to believe. Your clothes are different. The plugs in your arms and head are gone. Your hair is changed. Your appearance now is what we call residual self image. It is the mental projection of your digital self.
This.this is not real.
What is real. How do you define real. If you’re talking about what you can feel what you can smell what you can taste and see then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. This is the world that you know. The world as it was at the end of the twentieth century. It exists now only as part of a neural interactive simulation that we call the Matrix. You have been living in a dream world Neo. This is the world as it exists today Welcome to the Desert of the Real. We have only bits and pieces of information but what we know for certain is that at some point in the early twenty first century all of mankind was united in celebration. We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to AI.
AI. You mean artificial intelligence.
A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. We do not know who struck first us or them. But we know that it was us that scorched the sky. At the time they were dependent on solar power and it was believed that they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun. Throughout human history we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate it seems is not without a sense of irony. The human body generates more bio electricity than a one hundred and twenty volt battery and over twenty-five thousand BTU is of body heat. Combined with a form of fusion the machines have found all the energy they would ever need. There are fields endless fields where human beings are no longer born we are grown. For the longest time I would not believe it and then I saw the fields with my own eyes. Watch them liquefy the dead so they could be fed intravenously to the living. And standing there facing the pure horrifying precision I came to realize the obviousness of the truth. What is the Matrix. Control. The Matrix is a computer generated dream world built to keep us under control in order to change a human being into this.
No. I do not believe it. It is not possible.
I did not say it would be easy Neo. I just said it would be the truth.
Stop. Let me out. Let me out. I want out.


Easy Neo. Easy.
Take this thing off me. Take this thing.
Listen to me.
Do not touch me. Stay away from me. I do not want it. I do not believe it. I do not believe it.
He is gonna pop.
Breathe Neo. Just breathe.

I cannot go back can I.
No. But if you could would you really want to. I feel I owe you an apology. We have a rule. We never free a mind once it is reached a certain age. It is dangerous the mind has trouble letting go. I have seen it before and I am sorry. I did what I did because.I had to. When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside who had the ability to change whatever he wanted to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was he who freed the first of us taught us the truth. As long as the Matrix exists the human race will never be free. After he died the Oracle prophesied his return and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix and the war bring freedom to our people. That is why there are those of us who have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix looking for him. I did what I did because I believe that search is over Get some rest you are going to need it.
For what.
Your training.

Morning did you sleep. You will tonight I guarantee it. I am Tank I will be your operator.
You do not.you do not have any.
Holes. Nope. Me and my brother Dozer we are both one hundred percent pure old fashioned home grown human born free right here in the real world. A genuine child of Zion.
Zion.
If the war was over tomorrow Zion is where the party would be.
It is a city.
The last human city. The only place we have left.
Where is it.
Deep underground near the earth is core where it is still warm. Live long enough you might even see it. God damn I.I got to tell you I am fairly excited to see what you are capable of if Morpheus is right and all.I am not supposed to talk about this but if you are.a very exciting time. We got a lot to do. We got to get to it Now we are supposed to start with these operation programs first that is a major boring shit. Let is do something more fun. How about combat training.
Jujitsu. I am going to learn Jujitsu. Holy shit.
Hey Mikey I think he likes it. How about some more.
Hell yes. Hell yeah.

How is he.
Ten hours straight. He is a machine.

I know Kung Fu.
Show me.

This is a sparring program similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix. It has the same basic rules rules like gravity. What you must learn is that these rules are no different that the rules of a computer system. Some of them can be bent. Others can be broken. Understand. Then hit me if you can Good. Adaptation improvisation. But your weakness is not your technique.


Morpheus is fighting Neo.


How did I beat you.
Your too fast.
Do you believe that my being stronger or faster has anything to do with my muscles in this place. You think that is air you are breathing now. Again.


Jesus Christ he is fast. Take a look at his neural kinetics they are way above normal.


What are you waiting for. You are faster than this. Do not think you are know you are Come on. Stop trying to hit me and hit me.


I do not believe it.


I know what you are trying to do.
I am trying to free your mind Neo but I can only show you the door you are the one that has to walk through it. Tank load the jump program You have to let it all go Neo fear doubt and disbelief. Free your mind.

Whoa. Okie dokie. Free my mind.


So what if he makes it.
No one is ever made the first jump.
I know I know. But what if he does.
He wo not.
Come on.
Come on.


All right no problem. Free my mind. Free my mind. All right.


Wha.what does that mean.
It does not mean anything.
Everybody falls the first time. Right Trin.


I thought it was not real.
Your mind makes it real.
If you are killed in the Matrix you die here.
Your body cannot live without the mind.

I do not remember you bringing me dinner. There is something about him is not there.
Do not tell me you are a believer now.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure why does not he take him to see the Oracle.
Morpheus will take him when he is ready.


The Matrix is a system Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you are inside you look around. What do you see. Business men teachers lawyers carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it. Were you listening to me Neo or were you looking at the woman in the red dress.
I was.
Look again. Freeze it.
This.this is not the Matrix.
No. It is another training program designed to teach you one thing. If you are not one of us you are one of them.
What are they.
Sentient programs. They can move in and out of any software still hard wired to their system. That means that anyone we have not unplugged is potentially an agent. Inside the Matrix they are everyone and they are no one. We are survived by hiding from them by running from them. But they are the gatekeepers. They are guarding all the doors. They are holding all the keys which means that sooner or later someone is going to have to fight them.
Someone.
I wo not lie to you Neo. Every single man or woman who has stood their ground everyone who has fought an agent has died. But where they have failed you will succeed.
Why.
I have seen an agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air. Yet their strength and their speed are still based in a world that is built on rules. Because of that they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
What are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets.
No Neo. I am trying to tell you that when you are ready you wo not have to.


We have got trouble.

Did Zion send word.
No another ship. Shit. Squiddies. We have been in crick.
Squiddy.
A sentinel. A killing machine designed for one thing.
Search and destroy.
Set her down right over there How are we doing Tank.
Power off line. EMP armed and ready.
EMP.
Electromagnetic pulse. Disables any electrical system in the blast radius. It is the only weapon we have against the machines.
Where are we.
There old service and waste systems.
Sewers.
They used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles. Now these sewers are all that is left of them.
Quiet.

Whoa Neo. You scared the bejeezus out of me.
Sorry.
It is okay.
Is that.
The Matrix. Yeah.
Do you always look at it encoded.
Well you have to. The image translators work for the construct program. But there is way too much information to decode the Matrix. You get used to it. I.I do not even see the code. All I see is blonde brunette red head. Hey you a want a drink.
Sure
You know I know what you are thinking because right now I am thinking the same thing. Actually I have been thinking it ever since I got here. Why oh why did not I take the blue pill. Good shit huh. Dozer makes it. It is good for two things degreasing engines and killing brain cells. So can I ask you something. Did he tell you why he did it why you are here. Jesus. What a mind job. So you are here to save the world. What do you say to something like that. A little piece of advice. You see an agent you do what we do. Run. Run your ass off.
Thanks for the drink.
Sweet dreams.


Do we have a deal Mr. Reagan.
You know I know this steak does not exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years you know what I realize. Ignorance is bliss.
Then we have a deal.
I do not want to remember nothing. Nothing. You understand. And I want to be rich. You know someone important like an actor.
Whatever you want Mr. Reagan.
Okay. I get my body back into a power plant you insert me into the Matrix I will get you what you want.
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
No I told you I do not know them. I can get you the man who does.
Morpheus.


Here you go buddy. Breakfast of champions.
If you close your eyes it almost feels like you are eating runny eggs.
Yeah or a bowl of snot
Do you know what it really reminds me of. Tasty Wheat. Did you ever eat Tasty Wheat.
No but technically neither did you.
That is exactly my point. Exactly. Because you have to wonder now. How did the machines know what Tasty Wheat tasted like. huh.. Maybe they got it wrong. Maybe what I think Tasty Wheat tasted like actually tasted like oatmeal or tuna fish. That makes you wonder about a lot of things. You take chicken for example maybe they could not figure out what to make chicken taste like which is why chicken tastes like everything. Maybe could not figure out.
Shut up Mouse.
It is a single cell protein combined with synthetic aminos vitamins and minerals. Everything the body needs.
It does not have everything the body needs. So I understand that you have run through the agent training program. You know I wrote that program.
Here it comes.
So what did you think of her.
Of who.
The woman in the red dress. I designed her. She um.well she does not talk very much but.but if you would like to meet her I can arrange a much more personalized meeting.
Digital pimp hard at work.
Pay no attention to these hypocrites Neo. To deny our own impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human.
Dozer when you are done bring the ship up to broadcast depth. We are going in. Taking Neo to see her.
See who.
The Oracle Everyone please observe the fasten seat belt and no smoking signs have been turned on. Sit back and enjoy your ride.


We are in We will be back in an hour.


Unbelievable is not it.
God.
What.
I used to eat there. Really good noodles. I have these memories from my life. None of them happened. What does that mean.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
And the Oracle can.
That is different.
Did you go to her.
Yes.
What did she tell you.
She told me.
What.
We are here. Neo come with me.


So is this the same Oracle that made the prophecy.
Yes. She is very old. She is been with us since the beginning.
The beginning..
Of the resistance.
And she knows what everything.
She would say she knows enough.
And she is never wrong.
Try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong. She is a guide. She can help you to find the path.
She helped you.
Yes.
What did she tell you.
That I would find the one I told you I can only show you the door. You have to walk through it.


Hello Neo. You are right on time Make yourself at home Morpheus. Neo come with me These are the other potentials you can wait here.

Do not try and bend the spoon. That is impossible. Instead only try to realize the truth.
What truth.
There is no spoon.
There is no spoon.
Then you will see that it is not the spoon that bends it is only yourself.

The Oracle will see you now.

I know you are Neo. Be right with you.
You are the Oracle.
Bingo. Not quite what you were expecting right. Almost done. Smell good do not they.
Yeah.
I would ask you to sit down but your not going to anyway. And do not worry about the vase.
What vase.
That vase.
I am sorry.
I said do not worry about it. I will get one of my students to fix it.
How did you know.
What is really going to bake your noodle later on is would you still have broken it if I had not said anything. You are cuter than I expected. No wonder she likes you.
Who.
Not too bright though. You know why Morpheus brought you to see me.
I think so.
So what do you think. You think you are the one.
I do not know.
You know what that means. It is Latin. Means Know thyself. I am going to let you in on a little secret. Being the one is just like being in love. No one can tell you your in love you just know it. Through and through. Balls to bones. Well I better have a look at you. Open your mouth say Ahhh.
Ahhh.
Okay. Now I am supposed to say Umm that is interesting but. then you say.
But what.
But you already know what I am going to tell you.
I am not the one.
Sorry kiddo. You got the gift but it looks like you are waiting for something.
What.
Your next life maybe who knows. That is the way these things go. What is funny.
Morpheus. He.he almost had me convinced.
I know. Poor Morpheus. Without him we are lost.
What do you mean without him.
Are you sure you want to hear this. Morpheus believes in you Neo. And no one not you not even me can convince him otherwise. He believes it so blindly that he is going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
What.
You are going to have to make a choice. In the one hand you will have Morpheus life and in the other hand you will have your own. One of you is going to die. Which one will be up to you. I am sorry kiddo I really am. You have a good soul and I hate giving good people bad news. Oh do not worry about it. As soon as you step outside that door you will start feeling better. You will remember you do not believe in any of this fate crap. You are in control of your own life remember. Here take a cookie. I promise by the time you are done eating it you will feel right as rain.

What was said was for you and for you alone.



They are on their way What is that.


Whoa deja vu.
What did you just say.
Nothing I just had a little deja vu.
What did you see.
What happened.
A black cat went past us and then another that looked just like it.
How much like it was it the same cat.
Might have been I am not sure.
Switch Apoc.
What is it.
Deja vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens when they change something.


Oh my God.


Let is go.


They cut the hard line it is a trap. Get out.


Oh no. Oh no.

That is what they changed. We are trapped. There is no way out.
Be calm. Give me your phone.
They will be able to track it.
We have no choice.


Operator.
Tank. Find a structural drawing of this building. Find it fast.
Got it.
I need the main wet wall.


Eighth floor.
Eighth floor.

Switch straight ahead.
Neo. I hope the Oracle gave you some good news.


Another left that is it.
Good.


Where are they.

They are in the walls. They are in the walls.
It is an agent.
Morpheus.
You must get Neo out. He is all that matters.
No. No Morpheus. Do not.
Trinity go.
Go.
We cannot leave him.
We have to Cypher come on.

The great Morpheus. We meet at last.
And you are.
Smith. Agent Smith.
You all look the same to me.

Take him.


No.


Operator.
Yeah I need an exit fast.
Cypher.
Yeah there was an accident. God damn car accident. All of a sudden boom. Somebody up there still likes me.
Gotcha.
Get me out of here fast.
Intersection of Franklin and Erie an old TV repair shop.
Right.


Tank it is me.
Is Morpheus alive.
Is Morpheus alive Tank.
They are moving him. I do not know where to yet.
He is alive. We need an exit.
You are not far from Cypher.
Cypher.
I know. He is at Franklin and Erie.
Got it.


Got him.
Where are they.
Making the call.
Good.


You first Neo.


Shoot.
No.


I do not know it just went dead.


Hello Trinity.
Cypher. Where is Tank.
You know for a long time I thought I was in love with you. I used to dream about you. You are a beautiful woman Trinity. Too bad things had to turn out this way.
You killed them.
What.
Oh God.
I am tired Trinity. I tired of this war. I am tired of fighting. I am tired of this ship being cold eating the same God damn goop everyday. But most of all I am tired of that jack off and all of his bullshit. Surprise asshole. I bet you never saw this coming did you. God I wish I could be there when they break you. I wish I could walk in just when it happens. So right then you would know it was me.
You gave him Morpheus.
He lied to us Trinity. He tricked us. If you would told us the truth we would told you to shove that red pill right up your ass.
That is not true Cypher he set us free.
Free. You call this free. All I do is what he tells me to do. If I had to choose between that and the Matrix I choose the Matrix.
The Matrix is not real.
I disagree Trinity. I think the Matrix can be more real than this world. All I do is pull the plug here. But there you have to watch Apoc die.


Trinity.
No.


Welcome to the real world huh baby.
But you are out Cypher. You cannot go back.
Oh no. That is what you think. They are going to reinsert my body. I go back to sleep and when I wake up I wo not remember a God damn thing. By the way if you have anything terribly important to say to switch I suggest you say it now.
No please do not.


Not like this. Not like this.


Too late.
God damn you Cypher.
Do not hate me Trinity. I am just the messenger and right now I am going to prove it to you. If Morpheus was right then there is no way I can pull this plug. I mean if Neo is the one then there would have to be some kind of a miracle to stop me. Right. I mean how can he be the one if he is dead. You never did answer me before. If you bought into Morpheus bullshit come on all I want is a little yes or no. Look into his eyes those big pretty eyes. Tell me. Yes or no.

Yes.
No.


I do not believe it.
Believe it or not you piece of shit. You are still gonna burn.


You first.


You are hurt.
I will be all right.
Dozer.


Have you ever stood and stared at it marveled at it is beauty it is genius. Billions of people just living out their lives oblivious. Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world. Where none suffered. Where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed that we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that as a species human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. The perfect world would dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this the peak of your civilization. I say your civilization because as soon as we started thinking for you it really became our civilization which is of course what this is all about. Evolution Morpheus evolution like the dinosaur. Look out that window. You had your time. The future is our world Morpheus. The future is our time.
There could be a problem.


What are they doing to him.
Breaking into his mind. It is like hacking into a computer all it takes is time.
How much time.
Depends on the mind. Eventually it will crack and his alpha patterns will change from this to this. When it does Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Well what do they want.
The leader of every ship is given codes to Zion is mainframe computer. If an agent got the codes and got into Zion is mainframe they could destroy us. We cannot let that happen.
Trinity.
Zion is more important than me or you or even Morpheus.
Well there has to be something that we can do.
There is. We pull the plug.
You are going to kill him. Kill Morpheus.
We do not have any other choice.


Never send a human to do a machine is job.
If indeed the insider has failed they will sever the connection as soon as possible unless.
They are dead in either case.
We have no choice but to continue as planned. Deploy the sentinels immediately.


Morpheus you are more than a leader to us. You are our father. We will miss you always.
Stop. I do not believe this is happening.
Neo this has to be done.
Does it. I do not know I this cannot be just coincidence. It cannot be.
What are you talking about.
The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me that I would have to make a choice.
What choice. What are you doing.
I am going in.
No you are not.
I have to.
Neo Morpheus sacrificed himself so that he could get you out. There is no way that you are going back in.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed I am something I am not.
What.
I am not the one Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too.
No. You have to be.
Sorry I am not. I am just another guy.
No Neo. That is not true. It cannot be true.
Why.
Neo this is loco. They have got Morpheus in a military controlled building. Even if you somehow got inside those are agents holding him. Three of them. I want Morpheus back too but what you are talking about is suicide.
I know that is what it looks like but it is not. I cannot explain to you why it is not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed. I understand that now. But that is why I have to go.
Why.
Because I believe in something.
What.
I believe I can bring him back What are you doing.
I going with you.
No you are not.
No. Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you. I believe if you were really serious about saving him you are going to need my help. And since I am the ranking officer on this ship if you do not like I believe you can go to hell. Because you are not going anywhere else. Tank load us up.


I would like to share a revelation during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you are not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is. A virus. Human beings are a disease a cancer of this planet. You are a plague and we are the cure.


Okay. What do you need besides a miracle.
Guns. Lots of guns.


Neo no one has ever done anything like this.
That is why it is going to work.


Why is not this serum working.
Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions.
Leave me with him. Now.


Hold on Morpheus. They are coming for you. They are coming.


Can you hear me Morpheus. I am going to be honest with you. I hate this place this zoo this prison this reality whatever you want to call it. I cannot stand it any longer. It is the smell if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink. And every time I do I feel I have somehow been infected by it. It is repulsive is not it. I must get out of here. I must get free and in this mind is the key my key. Once Zion is destroyed there is no need for me to be here do not you understand. I need the codes. I have to get inside Zion and you have to tell me how. You are going to tell me or you are going to die.


Please remove any metallic items you are carrying keys loose change. Holy shit.

Backup. Send backup.

Freeze.


What were you doing.
He does not know.
Know what.

I think they are trying to save you.


There is no spoon.


Find them and destroy them.


I repeat we are under attack.

Trinity. Help.

Only human.
Dodge this How did you do that.
Do what.
You moved like they do. I have never seen anyone move that fast.
Was not fast enough. Can you fly that thing.
Not yet.


Operator.
Tank I need a pilot program for a V two one two helicopter. Hurry Let is go.


No.


Morpheus get up. Get up get up He is not going to make it Gotcha.


Trinity.


I knew it. He is the one.


Do you believe it now Trinity.
Morpheus. The Oracle she told me I am.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear that is all. Neo sooner or later you are going to realize just as I did there is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.


Operator.
Tank.
God damn. It is good to hear your voice sir.
Need an exit.
Got one ready. Subway station State and Balboa.


Damn it.
The trace was completed.
We have their position.
The sentinels are standing by.
Order the strike.
They are not out yet.


You first Morpheus.

Neo I want to tell you something but I am afraid of what it could mean if I do. Everything the Oracle told me has come true. Everything but this.


Neo.
What just happened.
An agent. You have to send me back.
I cannot.


Mr. Anderson.


Run Neo. Run. What is he doing.
He is beginning to believe.


You are empty.
So are you.

I am going to enjoy watching you die Mr. Anderson.


Jesus he is killing him.


Do you hear that Mr. Anderson. That is the sound of inevitability. That is the sound of your death. Goodbye Mr. Anderson.
My name is Neo.


What happened.
I do not know. I lost him. Oh shit.

Sentinels. How long.
Five maybe six minutes. Tank charge the EMP.
You cannot use that until he is out.
I know Trinity do not worry. He is going to make it.


Shit that is my phone. That is my best phone.


That is unknown.
Mr. Wizard get me the hell out of here.
Got a patch on an old exit Wabash and Lake.

Oh shit Help. Need a little help.
Door Door on your left. No you are other left Back door.


Oh no.
Here they come He is going to make it.


Fire escape at the end of the alley. Room three o three.


They are inside.
Hurry Neo

cannot be.


Check him.
He is gone.
Goodbye Mr. Anderson.


Neo I am not afraid anymore. The Oracle told me that I would fall in love and that man the man who I loved would be the one. And so you see you cannot be dead. You cannot be because I love you. You hear me. I love you Now get up.


No.


How.
He is The One.

Neo.


I know you are out there. I can feel you now. I know that you are afraid. You are afraid of us. You are afraid of change. I do not know the future. I did not come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it is going to begin. I am going to hang up this phone and then I am going to show these people what you do not want them to see. I am going to show them a world without you a world without rules and controls without borders or boundaries a world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you.
